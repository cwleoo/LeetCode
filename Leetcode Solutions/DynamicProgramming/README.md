# Dynamic Programming

## 1. Properties:

- Overlapping Subproblems
- (For optimal solution) Optimal Substructure: solution is made by making a sequence of choices and pick locally optimal choice. [same to greedy algorithm]

## 2. Relevant Topics:

- Arrays
- Recursion
- Recursion Formula
- HashMap
- Tree

## 3. Algorithms:

See post [here](DP_Algorithms/README.md).
