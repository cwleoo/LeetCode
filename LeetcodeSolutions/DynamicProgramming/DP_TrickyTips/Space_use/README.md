## 1) Space use promotion: 

sometimes it is necessary to promote the extra space use. If a DP algorithm only including several preceding elements, then it is possible to promote space from O(n) to O(1). Doing so can promote time performance, too. However, as for 2D arrays, the promotion from O(n^2) space to O(n) may or may not promote running time. It is worth to discuss the trade-off between these two approaches.
