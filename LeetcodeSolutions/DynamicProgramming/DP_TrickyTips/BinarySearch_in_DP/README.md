## 3) Use binary search in DP: 

use binary search to determine values of specific positions as well as the order of elements in DP arrays. It is useful to help **count the elements which is less than certain vale**. Normally using DP need O(n^2) time because we need to check each element before current element to decide the count. However, binary search will cut time into O(nlogn). For problems, it would be helpful to solve problem with "how many ..." or "the max number/length" ...
